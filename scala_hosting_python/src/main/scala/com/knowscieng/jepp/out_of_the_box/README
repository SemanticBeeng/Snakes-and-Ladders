Pages 8 through 58 in the annotated slide deck show how JEPP can help host Python from within a Scala program.

I used jep 3.1: https://github.com/mrj0/jep


To compile PythonAge.scala (you'll find jep.jar in /path/to/jep/build/java after installing jep via setup.py):

scalac -cp .:/path/to/jep/build/java/jep.jar PythonAge.scala 


To run PythonAge:

export JAR=scala_hosting_python/target/scala-2.11/scala_hosting_python_2.11-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
scala -cp $JAR:$JEP_CP com.knowscieng.jepp.out_of_the_box.PythonAge
